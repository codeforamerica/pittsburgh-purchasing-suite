    Hi there, Beacon subscriber! Over the last 2 weeks, no new opportunities have been posted on Beacon. All opportunities that were on Beacon are no longer taking submissions. Stay tuned, however! The City posts new opportunities about once a month, so there will be something new in your inbox soon. Thanks for your patience!
